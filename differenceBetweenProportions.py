'''
differenceBetweenProportions.py creates two proportions, MonteCarlo style,
from a known proportion in the population and from two sample sizes.
The two proportions are illustrated by two pie charts.
A third graphic shows the 95% confidence intervals for the proportions. 
A p-value is shown, highlighted green is p<0.05.
Alternate code allows the same visualization to be produced from real data.
