differenceBetweenMeans.py creates two samples, MonteCarlo style,
from a known mean and standard deviation in the population and from two sample sizes.
The two proportions are illustrated by histograms.
A third graphic shows the inferred heights and the p-value.
Alternate code allows the same visualization to be produced from real data
